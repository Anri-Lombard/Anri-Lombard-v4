                            <strong>That&apos;s me</strong>. Now, I know what you&apos;re thinking: "Was it fate, destiny, or a glitch in the Matrix?"

                            In <strong>2002</strong>, a jaw-dropping, dirty-blonde, hazel-brown-eyed demigod baby was born, destined to grace the covers of GQ...
                            and right next to him, I made my grand entrance just a few minutes later. While a future of magazine covers and chiseled abs awaited him,
                            I realized early on that <strong>my path would lead to nerdom, glorious nerdom</strong>.

                            But I don&apos;t just stop there. Most of my learning happens outside the hallowed halls of Uni, thanks to the ever-expanding universe of online education. It&apos;s there that I dive headfirst into the world of <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, aspiring to make a difference as a code wizard... err, I mean, engineer. <strong>My days are filled with the delightful dance of coding and studying</strong>, which not only brings me joy but also has the added benefit of never challenging me to a bench press competition ðŸ˜„.
