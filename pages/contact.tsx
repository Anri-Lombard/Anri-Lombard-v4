                Hard-to-reach kinda dude... but try lmbanr001@myuct.ac.za if you feel adventurous, or visit your local librarian and ask for the weird white kid that shows up on Sundays.

                Otherwise, if you're really eager, just click <span className="dissapear">HERE</span>.

                    I can't give you my number like this, but here's the plan:
                    1. Get into my uni,
                    2. Ask for a super short blonde chad that is obviously a lady's man,
                    3. Now don't go to whomever they mentioned,
                    4. Repeat

                    Eventually you'll find me :)
                </details>
            </div>
            
        </div>
    )
}
